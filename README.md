# ImageProc-PYNQProject
An image processing project created by Adam Getty, Ilija Koncar and Jack Wilkie.

All the necessary files and notebooks which document Group E's PYNQ project are included.

In the Jupyter folder, two further folders are located. 
Each of these contain a Jupyter notebook, an assets and bitstream Folder.
The assets folder contain all of the necessary imaging required to run the project.
If you wish to upload your own image then one can be added to the assets folder.
This can be included in the notebooks by changing the '/assets/peppers.png' path to '/assets/yourimagename'.
The bitstream folder contains the IP files created within the Vivado environment and are required to communicate with the hardware.

In order to run these projects the folders can be uploaded directly to a Jupyter evironment,
connected to a PYNQ-z2 board.

A further folder is provided which contains the .slx file required to open the block design in SystemGenerator.

The project is also available as a github repository under https://github.com/AdamGetty/ImageProc-PYNQProject.
